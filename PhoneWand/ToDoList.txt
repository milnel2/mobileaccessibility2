// ************************** PhoneWand ToDoList: ************************** //
// ******************************* Michael: ******************************** //
- TODO post demo day: (in general, for all of us)
	- For the list screen, add something like "1 of 6." add the beginning of speech
		so user knows which item she's at.
	- Double tap any where to select for lists


// ******************************** Chris: ********************************* //
TODO:
- add directions functionality that levi describes.
- organize the beast called RouteOrienter.
- get rid of all the extra annoying TODOs

RouteInput:
- swiping up to the keyboard should put the current route address in the keyboard initially

TouchKeyboard:
- a clear route button? maybe with a double tap confirm?

RouteOrienter:
- organize the monolithic mess called this code...
- TTS indicating a swipe has been made
- extract hidden swipe code into methods like rest of program
- get rid of commented out code...

CurrentLocation:
-- distance to end of route (if there is a route)
-- nearest intersection... meh
-- nearby places... double meh

DirectionsDisplay:
- keep a go back to map view at the very top of the list
- upon a double click, dump information about that route point
-- distance to that point from current location
-- expected time of arrival

Reference:
Address of Chipotle:
4229 University Way NE

Observable Bugs:
-compass heading or Compass drawing seem off a few degrees... could be the drawings...

// ********************************* Levi: ********************************* //

----- THE USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOUBLE TAP ANYWHERE TO SELECT AN ITEM IN THE SLIDERULE LIST

--- some day, we need to display Google Maps copyright information in conjunction with the directions...

- some day, implement efficient way for Chris's code to JUST redraw the current location icon when orientation changes (not the whole route)
- some day, implement a way for the code to ensure that the user's phone has the Google Maps library, and if not, to use the Google Maps Web API
