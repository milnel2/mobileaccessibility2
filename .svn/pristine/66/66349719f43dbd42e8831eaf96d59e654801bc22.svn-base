APPLICATION:  BrailleBuddies
============

=================
ANDROID VERSIONS:  1.6 or greater
=================

=========================
TESTED ON ANDROID PHONES:  Droid, G1, HTC Magic
=========================


================
GETTING STARTED:
================
Download the BrailleBuddies application file, BrailleBuddies.apk, which is located in the BrailleBuddies/bin directory, and install it on your Android phone[1].  

BrailleBuddies uses speech synthesis (Text To Speech) to speak instructions and game information to the user.  Before running the application, check the volume setting on your phone to make sure it is loud enough to hear.  Additionally, if you have enabled Android’s TalkBack Accessibility Service on your phone, you may wish to turn that service off while running BrailleBuddies to prevent being told twice (both by the BrailleBuddies application and the TalkBack service) that a menu item has been selected.  Alternatively, in the Settings menu within the BrailleBuddies application, you can disable the “Read menus when touched” option to prevent BrailleBuddies from speaking menu selections. 

After the application is installed, select the BrailleBuddies application from your phone’s applications listing to run the application.   

Instructions that tell you how to use each screen in the application are spoken when the screen is displayed.  You can repeat instructions by touching and holding on the screen for two or three seconds.  You can silence instructions currently being spoken by tapping once on the screen.

In general, the phone should be held vertically while playing BrailleBuddies.  The one exception is when the soft (input) keypad is displayed; the keypad is laid out in landscape/horizontally for easier navigation so when the input keypad is displayed, the phone should be held horizontally.


==========================
WHAT THE APPLICATION DOES:
==========================
BrailleBuddies is an educational, virtual pet game suitable for blind, low-vision and sighted users.  The game’s interface thoroughly incorporates the use of gestures, auditory cues and haptic feedback to guide the player through the activities.  The player creates a pet (specifically, a dog) and takes care of its needs, which vary as the game progresses.  The game is educational in that the player must read and write Braille characters in order to earn tokens that are used to care for the pet.


===========================
HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION:
===========================
Upon entry to the game, the main menu for the application is displayed.   This menu contains four options in the following order:  “Play” one of the preceding activities, “Instructions” for the activities, “Settings”, which lets you modify the application settings, and “Exit” to quit the application.

There are two modes for making menu selections: gestures mode and touch mode. 

In gestures mode, which is the default mode, use your finger to draw symbols on the screen that represent the menu option you want to choose.  Remember to keep the phone in vertical orientation when drawing symbols or they will not be read correctly.  The application will attempt to recognize the symbol and will automatically select the corresponding menu option.

In touch mode, place your finger at the top of the screen and drag down the menu.  Menu options will be spoken as you touch them.  Each option fills the entire width of the screen and all options together fill the height of the screen so as long as your finger is on the screen, you will be touching a menu option.  Once you touch (hear) the option you want, double tap lightly in that same location to select the menu option.

------
 PLAY
------
Selecting the Play option begins the game.  The first time the game is played, you are taken to the Pet Settings screen where you can customize your pet.  Use one finger to touch and drag down the screen to hear settings options.  These options include a “Change Name” button that displays a soft keypad (in landscape orientation) so you can enter a new name for your pet.  The other options are radio button selections for gender and breed.  Simply tap on the setting you want.  Tap on the “Finish” button at the bottom of the screen to continue with the game.

Next, the Pet Status and Activities screen will display.  This screen is the “home” screen for the game.  From this screen, you can get a current status of your pet (by touching your finger on the top quarter of the screen where status information is displayed) as well as select activities that allow you to care for your pet.  To select activities, a vertical “Activities” menu is displayed on the lower three quarters of the screen. 

Your pet’s status will change over time.  Some changes are automatic and others are the result of an activity you perform with or for your pet.  Each time the status changes, the application will speak the change to let you know.

Included in the status are
* Whether your pet is hungry
* Whether your pet need exercise
* Whether your pet is happy
* The number of tokens you have in your bank account


1) IF YOUR PET IS HUNGRY...
you need to feed him.  To do so, you must have food, which you purchase from the pet store using tokens.  When you start a game for the first time, you will receive an initial balance in your bank account of 20 tokens that allows you to immediately purchase food for your pet.  However, once you’ve used these tokens, you will have to earn more in order to buy more food for your pet.  To spend or earn tokens, select “SPEND/EARN TOKENS” from the activity menu.  A new menu displays from which you select the game(s) you want to play to earn tokens or go shopping once you have earned tokens.

  EARN TOKENS (GAMES TO PLAY):
  ----------------------------
  To earn tokens, select one of the following options from the menu:  Play ReadBraille, Play Write Braille or Play Braille Words.  In these games, tokens are awarded for correctly reading individual Braille symbols, writing individual Braille symbols and reading Braille words, respectively.  All three games employ a technology known as VBraille to simulate Braille symbols.

  VBraille divides the entire touchscreen into six regions such that each region represents a dot location within the standard Braille cell.  The dot locations are numbered with dots 1 through 3 going down the left side of the screen and dots 4 through 6 going down the right side of the screen.  To represent a Braille symbol, the filled dot locations vibrate when touched and the empty dot locations do not.  More accurately, touching in a region that contains a dot triggers the haptic device so that the entire phone vibrates.  For example, when the Braille letter A is shown, touching the screen in dot 1’s location will cause the phone to vibrate but as the finger is dragged down to dot 2 or across to dot 4, the vibration stops because the Braille letter A does not have a dot in  these locations.  Employing haptic feedback in response to the touching of a dot allows the blind user is to determine non-visually where dots exist and in turn, identify the Braille symbol being displayed.

  VBraille varies the vibration frequency so that the feel of the vibration for dots in row two differs from those in rows one and three.  To maximize the benefit of these differences, players should begin their touch in the upper left-hand corner of the screen and drag down the column before moving to the second column and repeating that motion.


  **** PLAY READBRAILLE ****
  In ReadBraille, you are presented with a random Braille symbol  without being told what it is. The symbol is depicted using white dots on a black background (provides a high contrast for players with low vision).  The verbal instructions will guide you to touch the screen and drag your finger around all six dot locations, using the resulting vibrations to determine which dots are shown.  As a new dot location is touched, the number of that dot is spoken to help you stay oriented within the Braille cell.  Once you know the symbol, press the trackball and a soft keypad for entering the answer will be displayed. 

  The keypad can be navigated by touching and dragging or by using the trackball.  As keys receive focus, their names are spoken so that you will know where you are.  When practicing with letters, both alphabetical and QWERTY touch keypad formats are available and you can specify which to use in a touch-based settings menu (see “Settings” section).  When you locate the answer you want, double tap or press the trackball to select that answer.  The hard keypad can also be used to select letters.  Spoken feedback will let you know whether your answer is correct.  If it is not, you may have the option to try again, depending on your application settings (see “Settings” section).  If you don’t know the answer, select the “Get Correct Answer” button on the soft keypad to hear the answer and return to the Braille symbol screen.  Alternatively, press the “Replay Symbol” button on the keypad to return to the Braille symbol screen and replay the symbol without giving the answer.

  There are three categories of symbols:  alphabet (letters), numbers and punctuation.  The default category is set in the Settings screen (see “Settings” section).  Press the phone’s Menu button whenever the Braille cell is displayed to switch among these categories.

  To leave the ReadBraille game, press the Back key on the device.  Before returning to the Spend/Earn Tokens menu, the results of your game play are spoken.


  **** PLAY WRITEBRAILLE ****
  WriteBraille is essentially the inverse of ReadBraille.  You are told the symbol to write and presented with a Braille cell containing only empty dots.  After navigating to appropriate dot locations using touch and audible cues, double tap on the locations to make dots appear.  Touching dots that have been entered will cause the phone to vibrate.  If you make a mistake, simply double tap again to remove the dot.  You can also shake the phone in a corner-to-corner diagonal direction to erase all dots and start over.  When you’re finished, press the trackball to find out if you entered the Braille symbol correctly.  As with ReadBraille, pressing the Men button switches among symbol categories and pressing the Back key reads your game play results before exiting the game.


  **** PLAY BRAILLEWORDS ****
  BrailleWords lets you earn tokens by reading multiple Braille symbols in a row and then inputting the word that the letters spell.  You earn more tokens for correctly entering words than you do for individual symbols in ReadBraille and WriteBraille.  

  Each word is presented one letter (i.e., Braille symbol) at a time.  Use the trackball or directional keys to back up or move forward through the letters in the word.  When you think you know the word, press down on the trackball or center directional key to display the input keypad.

  Answers are input in the same fashion as ReadBraille except that selecting letters adds them to the answer you are building.  To submit an answer, select the “Submit button” that is included on the soft keypad.  If you want to hear your current answer before submitting, select the “Speak Answer” button on the soft keypad. 

  There are three difficulty levels (defined based on the number of letters in the word) to keep the game interesting over time by accommodating improving Braille skills.  The default difficulty level is set in the Settings screen (see “Settings” section).  Press the phone’s Menu key to switch among these difficulty levels.  

  Pressing the Back key reads game play results, then exits the game.


  SPEND TOKENS (GO SHOPPING):
  ---------------------------
  To spend your tokens and purchase items for your pet, select the “Go Shopping” option on the Spend/Earn Tokens menu.   You will enter the Store screen, which shows each aisle in the store on a vertical menu.  You may enter any of the aisles and purchases items you find there.  Purchasing items works the same way in all aisles. (To feed your pet, though, enter the Food aisle.)
When you enter an aisle, the products in that aisle are displayed one at a time on the screen.  The name and price of each product is spoken when it is displayed.  The amount of that product you currently own is also spoken.  To repeat this information, tap once on the screen.  

  Use the scroll right/left gestures on the touchscreen or the directional keys to move through the products.  
To purchase the product currently displayed, double tap on the upper portion of the screen.  You must confirm the purchase by single tapping on the screen or by pressing down on the trackball or center directional key.  (Because the bottom portion of the screen contains a button that is also double-tapped to leave the aisle, this single-tap confirmation is needed to ensure that you actually wanted to purchase the product rather than to leave the screen.)


Now to Feed Your Pet...
Once you have earned tokens and purchased food from the store, you can feed your pet.  To do so, select the “Feed Your Pet” option from the Activities menu and follow the instructions.  You will be able to scroll through the products you have purchased in the same fashion that you scrolled through products in the Store aisles and select an item to feed to your pet in the same way you selected products to purchase in the store.  (For more details, see the “Spend Tokens” section.)


2) IF YOUR PET NEEDS EXERCISE...
you need to select “Exercise Pet” from the Activities menu and follow the instructions, which tell you to shake the phone back and forth.  The shaking motion gives your pet (and you) exercise.


3) IF YOUR PET IS NOT HAPPY...
you need to spend some time playing with him.  Select the “Play with Pet” option from the Activities menu and follow the instructions.  You will be guided to either stroke the screen (i.e., “pet your dog”) or hold down on the trackball/center directional key and talk to your pet.

Performing one of these activities (1 - 3) will change the appropriate status setting for your pet.

--------------
 INSTRUCTIONS
--------------
When selected, the Instruction option displays a new vertical menu from which you may choose whether to hear/read instructions for ReadBraille, WriteBraille, or BrailleWords.

After choosing the activity for which you want instructions, the instructions will be displayed one sentence at a time and the phone will read them out loud.  When the screen has been read, a “piano chord” sound will play, signaling the end of that sentence.  Scroll right (i.e., move your finger quickly across the screen from left to right) or press the right arrow on the directional pad to move to the next sentence in the instructions.  In case you need to repeat the current sentence, tap once on the screen.  To replay a prior sentence, scroll left or press the left arrow on the directional pad to move backward.  To leave the instructions page, press the back button on the phone.

----------
 SETTINGS
----------
Upon choosing the Settings option, instructions for navigating the screen are spoken and then all the current settings are read.  

The settings for the application are as follows:

1) Read Menus When Touched 
When enabled, this setting tells the application to speak menu options as the user touches or scrolls over them and when they are selected.

2) Replay Symbol After Correct Answer 
This setting applies to the ReadBraille activity.  When enabled, it causes the application to redisplay a Braille symbol after the user has currently entered it’s name in the soft keypad.

3) Display QWERTY Keypad 
This setting applies to the ReadBraille activity, which displays a soft keypad for the user to input his/her answer.  When enabled, the setting tells the application to display a QWERTY-layout keypad.  If not enabled, the keys on the keypad will be laid out in alphabetic order, left to right, top to bottom.

4) Symbol Mode:  Alpha, Num, Punct 
This setting tells the application which type of symbol to display by default when playing ReadBraille or WriteBraille.  The user can press the phone’s menu key to override this default and switch to a different symbol type.

5) Word Level:  Easy, Medium, Hard
This setting tells the application which word difficulty level to use by default when playing BrailleWords.  The user can press the phone’s menu key to override this default and switch to a different difficulty level.

6) Maximum Number of Tries: One, Two, Three 
This setting tells the application how many times the user can try to input the correct answer before the application provides the correct answer.  It applies to both ReadBraille and WriteBraille.

7) Speech Rate: .5, 1, 2, 3 
This setting lets the user speed up or slow down the rate at which the phone speaks.  The higher the number, the faster the speech.  “1” is considered normal speech rate.

The settings screen is navigated by touching the screen and dragging your finger around.  Each setting is read as it is touched.  To enable/disable a setting, tap once on it.  To change a selection value, tap on the value that is desired.  Press the Back key to leave the Settings screen and return to the Main Menu.
